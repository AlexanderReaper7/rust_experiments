# rust_experiments
This project provides a place to experiment and learn about all things concerning the rust language.
## Things done so far:
- compression with the zstd library, i choose this one because of its excellet compression ratio and extremely low decomression times.
- deserialising toml files 
- including files into to binary executable, this lets the executable act as its own installer (portable version)
- quick and easy mutithreading with the rayon library
- basic optimization of single/mutithreded functions
- benchmarking with the criterion library (though i already learned this from https://github.com/AlexanderReaper7/mine_sweeper)
- build scripts
## Still working on:
- embedding an icon into the executable
